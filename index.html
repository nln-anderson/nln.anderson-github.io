            <p>I grew up in the South Bay of Los Angeles and graduated from South High School in 2020. Given that I tutor 
                math, you may think that I was always good at math. The reality is the opposite - I struggled at math in
                middle school, especially Algebra 1, barely passing my classes. I know what it is like to feel lost and 
                confused in math. In high school, with the help of tutors and online resources, I started to excel in 
                math. I ultimately took AP Calculus BC my junior year and scored a 5 on the test! I also received a
                Spartan Laurel award for my achievement in Mathematics. That summer, I began working at a local tutoring center,
                with the hopes of helping others. Since then, I have begun tutoring independently. I tutored through the 
                pandemic, so I was able to master teaching learning on an online setting. I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude 
                from the University of San Diego with a degree in Mathematics! Outside of school, I love to surf, sail, and play guitar!

        <h2><a href="https://calendly.com/nolan-tutoring" target="_blank">Book an Appointment</a></h2>
        <p>By clicking the link, you can schedule a tutoring session. Tutoring takes place virtually. An email will be sent with a meeting link. The meeting is via Google Meet, 
            so a Google account is necessary (it is free). You will be able to join the meeting at the time it is scheduled. 
            I use a digital whiteboard that the students and I can write on, that way the lesson is more interactive. I recommend 
            a Microsoft account to make whiteboard sharing easier. Please contact me if you are interested in in-person tutoring or have general questions!
